  So I wanted to try making a tikka masala sauce with a pasta base along with my usual spaghetti meal prep. My boyfriend and I are already in love with Yo Mama’s sesame dressing and their traditional marinara sauces, but this time I decided to try out the basil flavor since I love basil already. Let me tell you, this sauce is the winner. I have to say it is my favorite tomato sauce out of all the sauces and I will definitely continue to use this sauce for my recipes.  Right when I opened the jar and tasted the sauce, it was the perfect amount of flavor and had enough garlic to my tastes so that I didn’t have to add too much more. (I really like the garlic flavor in the sauce because it really sets into the sauce while you cook it making it very rich and aromatic.)  It blended so perfectly with my Indian spices and made the ultimate tikka masala sauce.  My boyfriend even told me that my sauce ended up tasting better than an Indian restaurant he went to recently or the pre-made sauces we get from the jar.  I really do think it’s all thanks to the basil flavor in Yo Mama’s sauce. By itself, it was already delicious and it went perfectly with the pasta for my spaghetti meal as well.  Combined with Indian spices? It made the most delicious tikka masala sauce we have ever had. Can’t wait to buy more and make this again! This will definitely be my go-to sauce for my base and for my spaghettis in the future.

  Very good flavor, especially considering this sauce is low sodium and has no added sugar.  I feel like some of the negative reviews are missing the big picture... the flavor of this sauce comes from all natural ingredients instead of additives.  I’m on the Keto diet and try to eat low sodium, so the product appealed to me because of the very low net carb count.  I was surprised at how good the sauce actually tasted.  If you are using it as a pizza sauce I would recommend reducing it some to get it a little thicker, but overall I am very satisfied with the quality.  The price is a little high, but I think the flavor makes up for this.

  Bought a two pack and loved it and then bought a six pack. Upon arrival two jars of sauce were broken.  I contacted Yo Mama's customer service and they FedEx'd the replacements.  Great follow-up.

  I have done keto for awhile. One of my favorite meals is what I call a pizza bowl. Tomatoe sauce, hand full of shredded mozzarella, and a bunch a pepperoni. Normally if I go low sugar and carb sauce it is boring and just tastes like tomatoe soup. This has surprising delicious taste with low carbs and sugar.
-----------------------------------------------
  Yo Mamma's tomato sauces are excellent, especially for low-carb eating.  I especially like the basil.  My  husband is a red sauce pasta nut, with emphasis on the red sauce.  The basil is so good he actually pours it into a cup and eats it like that.  I don't go quite that far, but it is really good.  I have used it to make eggplant parmesan, meatballs parmesan--just about everything that calls for tomato sauce.  I don't even bother to make home made sauce any more.
-----------------------------------------------
  TLDR: Fantastic sauce ... light, vibrant, and robust. Will be ordering many times again.I've attempted my own pasta sauce many times over the years, but Yo Mamas has really seemed to perfect it with their tomato basil. The sauce is bright and flavorful, and balances out the acidity of the tomatoes very well. I'm surprised to be leaving a sauce review, of all things, but this sauce is really worth 5 stars.
-----------------------------------------------
   You can tell this sauce is amazing from the minute you open it up - it's so fragrant. It is an amazingly flavorful pizza and pasta sauce (and I'm sure I will come up with other uses as well). So worth the buy!
-----------------------------------------------
  I haven't tried their other pasta sauces but this one definitely makes me want to!Spaghetti is a solid go to meal on the weekdays when you don't have time to make anything else, which means it's really important to have quality pasta sauce. In the past, I would settle for cheaper more commercial sauces but realized almost instantly the difference when it comes to Yo Mama's. It honestly taste super fresh - the tomatoes, basil, consistency, everything about it tastes real and healthy. I threw it together with some bucatini pasta, fresh grated parmesan cheese, and a glass of red wine. The perfect, affordable dinner on a weekday night!
