  Lots of whining about this product being “gritty” or not mixing well. Have you noticed that the first ingredient listed is Rolled Oats?  What you are seeing is the carb source. Oats are not water soluble. That is ground up oats. Ugh.This product rocks. A wonderfully different variety of protein sources. Seriously good taste. Made from Whole Foods. What else do you need or want? Buy it already.

  A warning label for chemical lead?! Not ok

  People saying this is too gritty ignore its purpose. It’s supposed to be from the oats to actually fill you up to actually “replace your meal”. I haven’t had an issue with consistency but I have a little single serve rocket blender that mixes it for me in 3 seconds perfectly. I can imagine shaking would be hard to get it right. Single serve blenders are cheap and can be used for more than this so I would recommend that as well. The flavor is amazing (i got oatmeal choc chip) and would definitely be down to try another in the future. Price looks expensive but just break it down into your meals and its technically like $3 per meal. Good luck finding something as cheap, easy to make, and healthy as that doe $3. I got it on prime day for $50 and if I’d known how good it was then I would have gotten 2 of them. Now bad feelings after consuming it either. No bloat, no gas, just a tastey filling meal that takes less than 5 min to make consume and clean up after. I love cooking but not when I’m low on time. Also note that I have been on a weight loss/exercise healthy life style for the past 7 months and only got this two weeks ago and it has not thrown anything off by any means. If anything it helps because it’s cheap, easy, and healthy so I’m not eating anything else that would otherwise be junk when I’m in a rush. It gives me everything my body needs. I have used it both after a workout and just as a meal replacement in general. I believe they have a “lite” version for people concerned about their weight loss but it has not effected me as mentioned earlier.

  Love this stuff.It does exactly what it is made to do; replace a meal. I work midnights so it’s not always the easiest to eat 3 meals a day. I typically just do 2 scoops for a hold-me-over and I feel great.I’ve not had any negative side effects and never have that bloated feeling after chugging a shake down.Only thing I would ask is to add a little more fat content, but thats not a deal breaker for me.Also the taste is fantastic. It isn’t as smooth as a protein shake, but its main ingredient is oats so that is to be expected.

  Rolled oats are #1 on the ingredients list and it definitely shows, I tried using shaker style devices to mix this stuff with water or almond milk and it would stay somewhat clumpy with the large oats chunks very visible. I found if I shook it up then stuck it in the fridge for about an hour it would turn out fine, so I would just mix it the night before I was going to use it, or use the blender. Blended it would turn out fairly smooth, but the large oats were always there, landing on your teeth when drinking and you could kind of chew the shake if you wanted- it was strange. I just got the Banana Nut Bread and oats are #1 on there as well, but they don't stand out at all.This mixes VERY thick, 4 scoops to 16oz of liquid is almost the consistency of soft serve ice cream. I ended up usually going with 3 scoops (good luck finding the scoop in this giant container, it is probably at the bottom) to about 24oz as a tolerable thickness. 3 scoops to 16oz with the Banana Nut Bread however was actually on the THIN side, makes me wonder if the Fudge Brownie is an outlier compared to all the others.Had a shake after every workout and even used it as a meal replacement on off days (even though it says not to do that on the label), I liked it and would buy it again. If it mixed smooth with smaller oat pieces and was cheaper, I would consider stocking up with a few.

  I have really enjoyed the oatmeal chocolate chip flavor of MRE.  What attracted me to the MRE powder was the macros.  I primarily planned on using this as a meal replacement in the afternoon before my workouts.  For me, the fairly low fat content, mix of fast and slow carbs, and mix of protein sources was exactly what I was looking for.  It also has a good amount of fiber at 8 grams per serving.The taste is great, and it mixes pretty easily.  The powder also does not upset or negatively effect my stomach at all.  I also plan to pack this into plastic bags and take as a meal replacement with me when I go backpacking because I believe the macros are perfect for consuming while actively on a hike as a quick meal.

  One of the best tasting meal replacements I’ve had in a very long time. No need for a blender, unless you want to make it thicker or add frozen fruit to it.  I love that there’s no dairy in it and the carb source is oatmeal. Most others are whey and have additives for the carbs.Bonus fit me is that I only use 2 scoops for a shake, meaning I get 50 shakes out if one tub. Great value!!

  Noooooooo. Why why why would you change the ingredients. I have been using this product (strawberry shortcake) for over a year now it was amazing taste, results and everything. I would tell everyone about it and they agreed. But now they changed the ingredients it tastes nothing like strawberry shortcake and no longer has the rolled oats texture. It tastes NASTY!! & previously I would never get stomach pains or diarrhea which I do now with the new batch!!???  Why would you change a perfect product with so many positive reviews. Whyyyyy whyyyy whyyyyyyyy. Now I have to look for an alternative. Horrible!If you have any left with the old ingredients I’ll buy your whole stock!!!!
