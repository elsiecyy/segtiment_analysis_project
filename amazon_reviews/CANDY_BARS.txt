  Chocolate arrived stale, spoiled and previously melted.  It clearly has not been stored at proper temperature for some time.  See photo.  The Reese's and Kit Kats also showed signs of having been melted at some time.  The Reese's cups were misshapen (sagging) and the Kit Kats were stuck to their wrappers.

  Everyone should love something from this box. What kind of a person doesn't like kit kat? If there is, don't want to know about it. Hershey bars are just cheap and blah next to the glory that is imported Cadbury. And I personally don't like peanut butter but the wifey loves it so this is a win for us. Either way. You don't turn your nose up at chocolate whether it's good or not. It's for eating so you get it in your face and keep your complaints to yourself.We will be buying these every Halloween. At least 4 boxes. We have a skeleton with glow in the dark eyes, we keep him in a nylon coffin for when the kids come by, the candy bars we stick in the bones and in the skeletons mouth and the kids love it. Last year one little three year old boy threw himself in the coffin with all the candy bars. Hilarious and adorable.So we will be sticking with this box for that purpose. If a three year old is willing to throw himself into a coffin with a skeleton in it to get at them then you can't argue with it.

  Product is good if you are able and like to consume factory made sweets.My issue is that I did not think about delivery when I ordered the product.  I am partially paralyzed and have daily seizures.  Driving is not an option for me and the closest store is two miles away.  I ordered this product to give out at halloween.  Most products arrive via Amazon delivery and even though most drivers do not know how to use a doorbell, they do know how to use the air conditioner in the delivery vehicles.  This product arrived via UPS which is usually my preferred delivery service since the drivers know how to use a doorbell when dropping off a package.  The issue is the UPS trucks are not cooled in the back.My product arrived melted.  Melted factory chocolate is not the same after it has been melted.  I am not able to give these away at halloween and I am not able to eat them myself.I would recommend not ordering this product during warm weather.

  Melted completely. Some of the other reviews had said they had arrived with a ice pack to prevent melting. So I took a chance. However these did not have a ice pack. Temperatures today were around 87.
-----------------------------------------------
  I got these for a great price. I saw a lot of comments on them arriving melted etc. mine did not arrive that way at all. It was packaged in insulated padding and two ice packs. The ice packs weren't cold anymore, but the candy bars were still in perfect condition when arrived.  I knew they were coming and knew approx delivery times, so I made sure someone was around to get the package right away, because yeah, duh, they don't expect you to leave it outside for hours after delivery, melting in the sun.Anyways, I feel they did an excellent job packing these, considering the day it was delivered we were under a severe heat advisory, and had been the day before as well!Don't be afraid of purchasing these, they package them well, but be responsible and have a cool place, maybe leave out a cooler for the delivery guy?! If you can't be home when it's delivered.About the ProductThe Hershey's Chocolate Variety Pack is perfect for the home, office, ballpark, or anywhere that deserves a sweet treat.This assortment includes six KIT KAT Wafer Bars, six REESE'S Peanut Butter Cup packs, and six HERSHEY'S Milk Chocolate Bars.Individually wrapped, these full-size bars are perfect for gifting, sharing, or taking along as a delicious on-the-go reward.OU Kosher Certified, HERSHEY'S Chocolate and candies have been an American favorite since 1894.This product ships as one 18-count box.Product DescriptionSize: 18 CountItem Description All of your favorite Hershey's Chocolate bars are here in one package.

  YUMMY!! As a huge chocolate lover myself, as soon as I saw this I just couldn't help but buy it. Not to mention that I have 4 kids under the age of 9 that were just as excited about it as I was.This item arrived in a timely manner and looked exactly as it does in the picture! It comes with my 3 favorite candy bars and I'm pretty certain they are a household favorite for most. Here is what I received with my purchase.6 Reeses peanut butter cups6 Milk chocolate Hershey bars6 KitKat BarsEach chocolate bar tasted delicious and was just as fresh as if I had purchased it from the grocery store only a few minutes prior to opening it. I'm not quite sure how they managed to do it, but not one chocolate bar was even slightly melted.It has been really nice to just open my cupboard anytime me or one of my children want a special treat.Not only is this great to keep in the house, but it's also perfect to keep at work!!I am definitely pleased with my purchase and I would absolutely recommend it.

  This is my third time buying these. These arrived today in a completely liquid state. I put in the fridge but they came out in blobs of chocolate stuck to the wrapper. They looked and tasted bad! The "cool packs" that it was shipped in was hot. Every piece of packing material was very hot to the touch. I don't understand how that can happen. They must have carried that box around in a hot truck for hours before delivery. I don't understand how even the packing material was very hot!

  Les reese’s et kitkat étaient bons mais les Hershey’s avaient un goût affreux. L’achat reste rentable.
