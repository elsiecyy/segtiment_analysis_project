  We have a cat that has lived in our barn for 19 years.  She was not feral, as we brought her in the house from time to time and she would sleep with our daughter.  All that time in the barn she was a good mouser and kept away from the critters that invaded from time to time.  We supplemented her diet with dry kibble that we had to put in a cat feeder that the critters couldn't get in to.This last year her age started catching up with her and she started losing weight (I guess the mice were getting too fast for her).  Fearing she would not survive another winter, we brought her in the house for good.  So we had to find a food that she would eat.  We tried different brands of wet cat food, and the only one she likes is this Purina Pro Plan.  Now she has gained her weight back, and her coat is all fluffy  and soft again.  Hoping to have her around for a few more years!

  my girls love this stuff. Its pure cat crack. I have done a lot of homework on cat food brands and what is best, and I have had vets swear by purina as well as experts I have spoken to. When I switched them over, my once thin kitty is now a nice big chunker, with a big fluffy, silk coat she didn't used to have, and her kitten who I also moved to purina is nice and big and healthy, even a bit of a chunker herself. The variety pack is their favorite by far.
-----------------------------------------------
  The whole case was spoiled. The cats have been eating the same type and brand for years. They wouldn't touch any of the food in this case even though one of them can't eat dry food. I tried several cans over 4 days. Then I bought the exact same type from the store and they ate it voraciously.  I am concerned over the quality, possibly storage? at amazon. They did refund my money but I won't be buying this from them again.

  My boys LOVE the Purina Pro Plan Chicken and Rice wet food. I refused to give them Fancy Feast right off the bat - Apparently it's the equivalent of feeding someone fast food every day. I'm fairly health-conscious and avoid fast food at all costs, so why would I give it to the animals whose overall health is in my hands?Unfortunately, once my boys got neutered, they started to get a little... "fluffy." I switched them over to Purina's Weight Management Turkey and Rice to help knock off some pounds, and they didn't even blink an eye. This company makes quality, tasty food (at least the cats think so!) and I will continue to keep this item on my Auto-Subscription.

  Purina Pro Plan is a high-end cat food that generally is sold in pet stores rather than in supermarkets. I purchased this 24-pack of Pro Plan's Turkey and Cheese Entre through Amazon at what seemed to me a bargain price.  The price of the item has since been raised but it is still a good deal.As far as I can tell, the major attraction of this product for my kitty is the cheese. She loves turkey, but she gobbles up products with cheese, including this turkey and Pro Plan's beef and cheese and salmon with cheese with special gusto. It is always a treat to see her happy.I also feed my kitty the popular Friskies cat found which is about 25 percent of the cost of Pro Plan. I generally use the Friskies Indoor "Homestyle Turkey Dinner" and she is happy with it. Friskies of course often is criticized for its cheap ingredients and for its use of fillers. A comparison of the labels doesn't show a great deal of difference from the Pro Plan.  The Pro Plan's first five ingredients (after water) are turkey, liver wheat gluten, meat by-products, corn starch-modified, followed by the cheese.  The Friskies first five ingredients are turkey, wheat gluten, rice, meat by-products, and liver. Pro Plan has a ten percent protein content while the Friskies has 9 percent protein. There doesn't seem to be a great deal of difference, but sometimes one cannot tell the nature of the product from the labels. And different ingredients might be balanced differently.  The manufacturer is not terribly forthcoming with information, but the Good Guides ratings on which I rely gives Pro Plan products a high rating while most Friskies products receive a lower rating.  Neither product is grain-free; but the benefits of grain-free cat food, I think, have been substantially exaggerated. And my kitty doesn't like most grain-free wet foods.It is a matter of what you think you are getting for the money.  I tend to think Pro Plan is worth the extra expense but I have doubts and a guilty conscience.  I alternate among the Pro Plan and the Friskies for the turkey portion of kitty's diet as well as for other portions, such as beef. That way I get the benefit of what purports to be a better quality food together with some economizing. It is a choice between budget and the desire to splurge on a product that may be somewhat healthier for the cat.Robin Friedman

  My cat wouldn't touch this with a ten foot pole. I think its something about how Amazon stores their cat food. My cat won't eat certain foods from Amazon that he will eat from other stores.  I think if cat food is stored near some other food cats don't like,  that it makes the food pick up a smell. We (humans) can't pick up the scent but cats can.  At least thats what purina says.

  I started feeding my male cat a wet food diet after he had a scare with FLUTD (sp?). I heard that cats are not supposed to eat dry kibble because they aren't natural water drinkers and should get most of their moisture/water from the small animals they kill, out in the wild. The dry kibble leaves them constantly dehydrated and allows for a buildup of crystals in their bladder which leads to deadly urethra blockages.ANYWAYS, the Hills Science Diet was too pricey so I was happy that Purina had a wet food specialize for urinary tract health and we were using that for a bit but it gave one of our other cats diarrhea. So we switch to this which has a high water content....and they both started getting diarrhea. SO....we tried the grain free wet foods and those seem to be helping get their bowels back to normal. I can't win with these cats LOL. I'm not sure why this gives my boys the runs so if your cat has a sensitive tummy......try the grain free. Truth be told, cats don't eat rice; it's just a filler to keep them fuller longer since this has a higher water content.

  Order arrived very fast and Phoebe really liked it. Being used to transition her from outdoors and also to loose weight by eliminating grain.The Purina Pro Plan formula is rich in protein from meat and carrots.  Ordering more now to stock up for the winter.  Will keep her happywhile stuck indoors.
