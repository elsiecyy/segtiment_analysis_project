  Don’t be fooled this is not tart cherry juice concentrate.  It should be called severely watered down tart cherry juice.  I have purchased over the years a true source of organic tart cherry juice concentrate. When it’s truly concentrate the liquid is somewhat syrup like.  This product is not even close it tastes very watered-down and very bland in flavor. All that means is this product is definitely not concentrated. Save your money don’t buy this for it is a rip off.

  This product shocked me.  Had a very bad torn meniscus which my Doctor said will require a knee replacement.  I constantly felt the inflammation from the bone on bone.  The first time I tried this I would say about an hour later I immediately felt a difference.  I use to regret getting up in the morning because the first thing I would feel in the morning is the pain from bone on bone.  Not anymore.  This did not heal or replace my meniscus but it sure has provide a great deal of relief and allowed me the movement I needed to get back into the gym and work on building my quad back up.  I would and have recommended and will continue to use this produce daily.

  I only have one other brand to compare this with, but the other one, from Stanton Orchards, is markedly better. The flavor of the Dynamic Health is fine, but it's weaker and thinner than Stanton Orchard's product, which is very thick and robust. And because the Stanton product is more concentrated, you need less of it for whatever you're using it for.I got the Dynamic Health brand because I have Amazon Prime and Stanton Orchard's only seems to be sold here by the case. But after I finish this bottle I'm making the trek back to Whole Foods to get Stanton's.

  I previously had bought the 16 oz bottle sold by Wellica which was fine and the juice was thick.. When I opened the 32 oz plastic bottle the juice was extremely watery and didn't taste as good as the smaller bottle. I will purchase again but will buy the smaller bottle and see if I notice any difference.

  This product is beneficial to me because it helps me to sleep well through the night.  In spite of never having been a deep sleeper all my life, I didn't expect my sleep patterns to get worse as I got older, but they did.  A friend told me about Tart Cherry Juice and it has made a big difference for me.  I'm told it has pain relief qualities as well, but I notice the benefit of it as a sleep aid as its most important function.  I plan on buying it from now on.

  Received bottle full of mold.  Seal intact.  Make sure to inspect prior to using so you don’t become sick.

  I take 2 Tablespoons  daily and I really think it has made a huge difference  in my arthritis pain. I take Meloxicam daily and my knees got so bad I was having to take Motrin as well. That is a bad combination.. lots of stomach distress.. I stopped taking Motrin and started cherry juice. It has helped

  This has a nice somewhat thick consistency, a little less thick then pancake syrup. Has a great taste with little bitterness. My rating is only for its quality, the jury is still out as to if it helps my sore knees. I have ordered a second bottle. I have a 4oz glass beaker, I use 2oz of cherry juice, fill the rest with water to thin it a bit and down it goes, taste great!
