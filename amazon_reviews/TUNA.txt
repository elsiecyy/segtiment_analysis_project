  Tastes so good you can almost imagine yourself being a vicious shark stalking that juicy, succulent tuna with a camera man following you around because it's shark week on the discovery channel and this is your time to prove that you are the sharkist of sharks so that the other sharks won't make fun of your fins anymore and those pesky dolphins stop poking at your gills and giggling behind your back but it's ok because you made a deal with a pucker fish who was impressed by your sharkiness to reside in the dolphins blower hole whenever they poke fun so you can have the last laugh.

  I've ordered this in the past, and I have been pleased.However, this last order, I got a returned box of tuna packets. How did I know it was returned? It was improperly sealed.The top of the box was not sealed with tape like normal. It was cut, and the box was closed by folding the cardboard flaps. When I opened the box, I found out why it was returned... one of the packets was not sealed, giving the entire box the fragrance of home-made fish sauce.

  - I've made several purchases of the large packs in the past, so, when I saw these little single-serving packs for such a reasonable price, you bet I ordered them!  =;-) - I know the case are a bit less expensive, but with the pouches, I don't have to stand and drain the cans (and lose what I think are far too many little tuna bits in the process).  Since I can't stand for more than, literally!, a couple minutes at a time, the ability to be able to just sit at the counter to do *all* the preparation of any meal, including lunch, gives me that much more independence, AND lets me have more nutritional *and* tasty meals than I otherwise would be able to have. - I do wish mylar packaging was recyclable, like the cans are, but hopefully someone will figure that part out ;)  For now, I think the Star Kist soft-pack tuna has a great flavor, AND helps make my life easier :)

  Each pouch is enough to make one complete sandwich.  The biggest pro is that you can rip the pouch open and you don't have to drain the tuna.  The simple act of not using the can opener and squeezing the water out with the top of the can is a huge plus for me.  Unfortunately, you pay for this convenience and you probably pay even a little more on Amazon, because they ship it to your door.My favorite way to make this into tuna salad:One pouch of tuna, one tablespoon of Miracle Whip, half a small dill pickle chopped, and salt and pepper to season it.  You can add more Miracle Whip or pickles depending on the consistency and crunch factor that you are seeking.  If you hate pickles, you can substitute celery.  Mix it all together, spread on bread, and enjoy!

  I use these for lunch every few days prepared with tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, salt and spices There is a recipe for this on each pouch, that I use only as a broad guide. I've been experimenting with the spices and so far find that Italian spices, cumin, garlic, paprika, chili pepper and Himalayan salt does very well to neutralize the tuna flavor with 5 minutes of simmering in a 2 quart lidded saucepan followed with addition of lemon juice and the tuna that are kept cold to help cool down the soup. The tuna is added easily just by tearing open one pouch, squeezing all of it into the saucepan and mashing it into small pieces with a fork.I use the 2 quart saucepan deliberately to reduce the total amount of liquid compared to the recipe so it can all be consumed easily at once and do not bother measuring the amounts of spices or even tasting the mix before the tuna has been added.  This could serve 2 people about 1 quart each with 20 grams of protein.

  My cat is a fussy eater and we finally found something he liked to eat. So I ordered a total of 20 boxes from this seller. 3 orders in total. Should be 240 pouches total but in my very last order I found one of the boxes missing 1 pouch. I usually open and check all my shipments once they arrive as more often than not I find errors in them. Im not happy about having to count every time to see if I got what I paid for but hey atleast it wasn't 12 missing pouches. So I let it slide. But I suggest counting to check if you have received your complete order or not.

  This to i ordered my son in the Navy to ship to him. He loves this tuna in the packs, it's sooo convenient for him to just open up a package and eat it straight out of the bag. There are so many things our military men can't get out to sea and this is one of them. I will be ordering more and sending them out to him in the next box, this is something I will keep on hand just for him.

  Love the tuna but hate the delivery 📦 package came all beat up. You can tell how my tuna pouches had fallen out of the factory box. Looks like someone put the pouches back in the factory box, the pouches were all different ways as shown in the pics. The factory box came open just as the pics show that I have attached.
