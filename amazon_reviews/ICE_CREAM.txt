  This Whynter ICM-200LS is very identical to The Ariete - DeLongi 
-----------------------------------------------
   and the Gourmia GSI400 
-----------------------------------------------
   .  Side note: I'll briefly compare these units to Cuisinart ICE 100 
-----------------------------------------------
   and the Breville BCI600XL 
-----------------------------------------------
   and the Lello 
-----------------------------------------------
   toward the end of the review.  The Whynter ICM-15LS and the Knox 1.5 are also identical with their smaller capacity of 1.5 Quarts (though the stickers say litres which I guess is technically about 6% more volume than the Quarts advertised)  All these Chinese made units have the same company bringing the UL listing, specs, and design to market from the company Intertek.  The lids are also identical as are the plastic paddles as are the mechanisms that attach to the bottom of the bowls/paddles. Regardless of the specs listed, I had access to a couple of these machines and they all weigh about 26 pounds according to my calibrated shipping scale.  The dimensions are about 16 5/8 inches length x 11 1/16 inches width by 8 7/8 inches height.  Since they seem to have the same motors that spin around 25 RPMs, the same refrigerant for the cooling action and the same interchangeable aluminum container that houses the mixture, what are the differences you ask?Well, the difference is mostly cosmetic with some differences with button controls on the LCDs.  All the 2+ quarts makers (Whynter ICM-200LS; Ariete-Delonghi & Gourmia GSI400) feature a power button, a start/pause button, and a menu button.  The Whynter ICM-200LS has two additional buttons to increase or decrease time.  The two others (Ariete-Delonghi & Gourmia GSI400) have a round knob that you turn to incrementally increase or decrease time.  Otherwise the built-in software and the LCD readouts are absolutely identical.  You can toggle between the 3 modes of "ice cream" ; "cooling only" ; or "mixing only."  When you power the units on, they all default to 60:00 minutes which you can toggle down if you prefer less time (either by turning the knob on some models or pressing the buttons on the Whynter)  They all go to automatic cooling mode for 10 minute increments after the ice cream is finished churning for the prescribed amount of time.  They all have the safety function to shut the motor off in the event of an overload should the machine not be able to muscle through the mixture if it freezes too hard while churning.  The "Cooling only" mode is good if you want to pre-chill the bowl before pouring in your mix which could lessen the total contact time and make for a creamier end result... of course you could also throw the bowl in the freezer for 5-10 minutes to achieve this effect if you get a machine without this feature.A word about the warranties.  They all seem to have a one year limited warranty except the Knox which is as unknown as the company itself.  The real issue is that the warranty covers against manufacturers' defects.  It is important to realize that these units are mini freezers which mean they have a compressor with sealed oil.  If the units travel on their side or upside down, they need to be place right side up for at least 4 hours and preferably 24 hours to make sure all of the oil drips out of the sealed housing.  If it is run with oil in it, it will break and though make noise like it is working, it will not cool a thing.  This also means that if you store the unit on it's side or back, you have to wait many hours with it right side up to safely turn it on.  If you turn it on and it doesn't get cold because there was oil in the compressor, it probably wouldn't be covered as a manufacturer defect.These units all make excellent ice cream and excellent gelatos.  Since they spin at 25 RPM's per minute, you will never be introducing air into the cream like what is done with commercially made ice cream.  More dense ice cream and gelato is the premium product we want at home anyway.Other differences between the units is that some user manuals are marginally better than others.  Some give you more recipes than others.  Some give you silly extras like a cheapy plastic scoop (with the Whynter) or a cheapy plastic measuring cup (with the Ariete - DeLonghi) or a cheapy plastic spatula.What about the Cuisinart, the Breville and the expensive 3x cost Lello?The Cuisinart is VERY similar, also built in China like the ones mentioned above, but does seem to have a slightly different motor as it spins at 26 RPMs.  Cuisinart seems to have gone through their own certification and design process and did not rely on Intertek.  Though if you turn the unit upside down, it is very identical in design of the rest with the exact same access points to get to the internals if need be.  The interface of the Cuisinart is less robust and only has 3 buttons and very much resembles the software of the 1.5 litre Whynter and Knox.  It will also default to a 10 minute "Keep Cool" cycle after mixing, like the above units.  It is a 1.5 quart machine and It does not have the cooling only and mixing only functions so it is most similar to the Whynter ICM-15LS and mystery company Knox brand.  It does have a different paddle design and in fact comes with 2 paddles, one for ice cream and one for gelato.  This to me is a little gimmicky though as at 26 RPM's you'd be hard pressed to get any better whipping action (air injection) from the cream in the ice cream... again with the understanding that commercial units like Emery Thompson units generate RPMS closer to 200 with the intent of aerating ice cream.  Gelatos are meant to be spun at low RPMs regardless so all these home units are excellent for gelato.  The warranty is a whopping 3 years though I have never dealt with Cuisinart on a warranty claim.How about the Breville?  It is proprietary and of good Australian Quality with it's own unique interface and software.  The aluminum mixing tub is a proprietary size and is tall and narrow.  It is on the smaller size of 1.5 quarts.  The warranty is 1 year.  The design premise is the same as the others mentioned.  The proprietary motor is faster though... spinning at about 50 RPMs, so it should be able to aerate ice cream more if that's something you desire.  Unfortunately there is no way to toggle the speed downward or play with the temperature... not that there is with any of these home units.  The Auto interface on the Breville is really just able to reduce the time and slap a name on the adjusted time. gelato = less time; ice cream = more time.  This could be such a great unit and would be worth the additional money if you could adjust the RPMs and cooling temp, but again none of these models can do that.The Lello is interesting as their design is based on a setup where there is no removable bowl.  This inherently is similar to a sealed commercial setup that should allow the compressor to work more efficiently. -And in theory if you can freeze your mix more quickly, you should have less crystals and creamier ice cream.  Of course commercial units also use the efficiency of gravity like front load commercial washing machines.  The Lello is small and more of a pain to clean as a result and it does have an issue where the spinning pin can get fouled near the top if not cleaned very well.  It is very well made in Italy with mostly metal components including the paddle and has a one year warranty.For my money, I think I would lean on the Ariete - Delonghi  or Gourmia as they can be had for $199.99 at the time of this review.  If the Whynter would be the same price, then it would be a toss up in my opinion.  The Whynter has oscillated in price between $260 and $350 over the past year and the Cuisinart is a little more expensive with less features and smaller capacity though a better warranty.  Except for the mystery brand Knox and unavailable warranty information, I do not think you can go wrong with any of the machines listed above.  The machines are identical enough that your recipes will have the biggest impact, so you may be better served by being price conscious.  To me the Lello is cost prohibitive at $700 and I don't care for the design overall as the efficiency doesn't do much to the end result.  Similarly, I do not think the Breville which is $380 as of this writing has any advantages that warrant the price.  Understand that all of these machines will make excellent tasting ice cream or gelato.  You'd be hard pressed to tell a difference using the same recipe on any of the machines except in a side by side taste test where you're really trying to be picky about the perfect creaminess, aeration, lack of ice crystals, etc.  Good luck on your purchasing decision.

  Great machine, I am a mechanical engineer and compared/contrasted several units prior to purchasing this one.  Based on the price, quality, functionality, and features it is a great buy.  It has been used to make two batches of icecream twice a month for the last three months.  Nice large capacity.  Really freezes the mixture.  Mixture gets so thick the motor strains, so when it sounds like its under very heavy load and starts to slow down, shut it off.  There is an auto-shutoff but I personally would rather not have the machine work so hard before the auto-shutoff is triggered.The bucket sits tightly in the sleeve.  This is needed for the heat of the liquid in the bucket to be transferred to the refrigerant in the sleeve.Nice unit, cleans up easily.Don't use the unit if it has been placed on its side or up-side-down.  I made sure it sat right-side-up for a couple days before using it.  I read that this machine failed after people used it immediately after unboxing it while it was up-side-down or sideways.Very happy, thank you!
-----------------------------------------------
  Update June 27 2019: I make at least one batch a week, usually 2, and it still works beautifully. I do take the gear shaft and gasket off every few months and give it a good scrub and re-lube, because the gasket can get quite funky.Original:I got lucky and saw this one on sale for a price that I couldn't pass up. Is it the $750 italian machine? No. But it works very well if you follow the basic rules of making frozen desserts and read the manual. I have more counter space than freezer space, and my ICE-21 is getting pretty tired after the workout I've given it.I've had it for about a week now, made 6 batches of ice cream. I think that it might be quieter than the Cuisinart ICE-21, which wouldn't be hard but is an unexpected bonus.Starting in the second batch, and all through the third, it made the infernal squeaking noise that some people mention. I was about ready to call up Whynter and see about getting a warranty replacement bowl. But after I washed it clean from the third batch of ice cream I took a look at the bottom gear thingy where it mates to the motor gear. There are two holes in the teeth prongs. I figured that I might as well try lubricating the thing before assuming it was faulty. So I used sewing machine oil, because I know that it won't harm metal or nylon, and that spot is not in contact with food. I then turned the gear thingy by hand a few times to disperse the oil, and it doesn't squeak anymore! Even after washing.NOTE: I'm reasonably comfortable with the idea of consuming traces of the stuff I use on sewing machines, as I probably do anyway, but it isn't food grade so I am not suggesting that anyone else should do it. You should probably contact Whynter and ask them what to use. If you are going to try lubing your bowl gear, please note that it might void your warranty. Also, please use something the won't make the problem worse or poison you. Mineral oil (food grade or USP) is probably a good choice, or if you have industrial food grade silicone oil or grease just laying around that would be better. DO NOT use WD40 or 3in1 or anything that calls itself a penetrating lubricant. Don't use those on your sewing machine either.

  After almost a decade of using the freezer bowl style of ice cream maker, this machine is a delight. Heavy and bulky (as expected for something with a freezing unit in it) but quiet and effective. Noticeable improvement in the quality of the final product. Easy to assemble, use, and clean. I love being able to make multiple batches at once for layered or swirled desserts.Only downside is the paddle is annoyingly shaped and hard to scrape off completely. Lots of tight corners. But I think that's the case with most modern ice cream makers.
-----------------------------------------------
  I love making my own icecream. I used to have another brand I loved as well but because of an international move we are not able to use it anymore. I ordered this one after reading good consumer and tester reviews. Also a good pricepoint for a home icecream maker.I'ts easy to operate with just a few buttons as long as you know what you are doing. Meaning that you have to understand that the base temp of the mixture dictates how long it needs to churn. For example if the mixture is still a bit warm it will obviously take longer and that will influence the texture.I have made gelato, icecream and sorbets and they turn out beautifull.The only minus I could give is that the buttons are a bit loose and stiff at the same time. Loose to touch but to set it up you need to push pretty hard. This has not changed in the 2 years that I have it.
-----------------------------------------------
  i will never be buying ice cream from the store ever again. this is an amazing machine, and i can make several batches in a day.
-----------------------------------------------
  Love my ice cream machine!!  Best in the world.  I waited to use it before reviewing.  No complaints ar all. I cannot imagine ever eating store bought ice cream again. Obviously, after reading articles on making ice cream, I’ve come up with my own recipes.  Also, after tasting real ice cream and making it fresh when you want, I actually eat less.
-----------------------------------------------
  I purchased this maker in Dec. 2018.  Ist time use was in Jan. 2019. I was sooo excited to see it work. It did not make ice-cream. After the 60min. nothing had changed with the consistency.  I was so frustrated wondering what went wrong and returned to making ice-cream with my old maker.  Last week May 2020,  I decided to try again as I wanted so much to use this maker to make lots of different kinds of ice-cream.  Once again..nothing happened.The basket just doesn't get cold at all.  What went wrong and how can I fix this? This is a huge investment for it not to work. Please advise.
